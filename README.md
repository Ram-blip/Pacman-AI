Artificial Intelligence, Pacman Game (Fall 2016)
======================================

## Intro
[The Pacman Projects](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) by the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu/). It was the same project but we had different implementations in our Course CS 205 at UCR.

> In this project, Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. Try to build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

> Implemented foundational AI algorithms - BFS, DFS, A*, and Uniform Cost Search - to navigate Pacman through mazes, reach destinations, and consume all available food items. Designed by UC Berkeley as a learning tool, this project deepened my understanding of AI search algorithms and their real-world applications in complex pathfinding problems. Also, enhanced Python codebase with modular structure and best practices for readability and maintainability.
